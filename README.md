## Changelog

See the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) file for details about all the latest features and improvements.

## Configuration

On the plugin's Settings screen:

1. **OpenAI API Key**: Paste a valid OpenAI API key. The plugin uses this key for translation requests.
2. **GPT Model**: Select one of the available GPT-based models. Only GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o variants are permitted.
    - mini: Balanced cost (~$0.02/$0.04) & quality.
    - nano: Fastest & cheapest (~$0.01/$0.02), lower nuance.
    - normal: Highest fidelity (~$0.03/$0.06), higher latency & cost.
3. **Translatable Field Types**: Pick which field editor types (single_line, markdown, structured_text, etc.) can be translated.
4. **Translate Whole Record**: Decide if you want the sidebar feature that allows users to translate every localized field in the record at once.
5. **Translate Bulk Records**: Decide if you want the bulk translation feature that allows users to translate multiple records at once on the table view.
6. **AI Bulk Translations Page**: Translate whole models at once.
7. **Prompt Template**: Customize how translations are requested. The plugin uses placeholders like `{fieldValue}`, `{fromLocale}`, `{toLocale}`, and `{recordContext}`.

_**Models**_: To ensure optimal translation quality, latency, and cost predictability, only GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o families are supported. These models balance fidelity, speed, and price for translation workflows.

Save your changes. The plugin is now ready.

## Usage

### Field-Level Translations

For each translatable field:

1. Click on the field's dropdown menu in the DatoCMS record editor (on the top right of the field)
2. Select "Translate to" -> Choose a target locale or "All locales."
3. The plugin uses your OpenAI settings to generate a translation.
4. The field updates automatically.

You can also pull content from a different locale by choosing "Translate from" to copy and translate that locale's content into your current locale.

### Whole-Record Translations

If enabled:

1. Open a record that has multiple locales.
2. The "DatoGPT Translate" panel appears in the sidebar.
3. Select source and target locales, then click "Translate Entire Record."
4. All translatable fields get updated with AI translations.

### Bulk Translations from Table View

Translate multiple records at once from any table view:

1. In the Content area, navigate to any model's table view
2. Select multiple records by checking the boxes on the left side
3. Click the three dots dropdown in the bar at the bottom (to the right of the bar)
4. Choose your source and target languages
5. The translation modal will show progress as all selected records are translated

### AI Bulk Translations Page

The plugin includes a dedicated page for translating multiple models at once:

1. Go to Settings â†’ AI Bulk Translations (in the sidebar)
2. Select your source and target languages
3. Choose one or more models to translate (block models are excluded)
4. Click "Start Bulk Translation"
5. The modal will display progress as all records from the selected models are translated

## Contextual Translations

The plugin now supports context-aware translations through the `{recordContext}` placeholder:

- **Benefits**:
  - Better understanding of specialized terminology
  - Improved consistency across related fields
  - More accurate translations that respect the overall content meaning
  - Appropriate tone and style based on context

## Customizing Prompts

You can customize the translation prompt template in the plugin settings:

- Use `{fieldValue}` to represent the content to translate
- Use `{fromLocale}` and `{toLocale}` to specify languages
- Use `{recordContext}` to include the automatically generated record context

## Excluding Models or Roles

- **Models to Exclude**: You can specify model API keys that shouldn't be affected by translations.
- **Roles to Exclude**: Certain roles can be restricted from using or seeing the plugin features.

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid API Key**: Ensure your OpenAI API key is correct and has sufficient usage limits.
- **Localization**: Make sure your project has at least two locales, otherwise translation actions won't appear.
